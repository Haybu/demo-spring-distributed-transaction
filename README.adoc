# Microservices Distributed Transaction Management

This demo project illustrates managing a distributed transaction in a
microservices architecture.

A Global Transaction Manager (GTM) is implemented as a Saga pattern to
manage orchestrating transactions across individual services.
The implementation leverages a Spring State Machine to coordinate progression amongst
global transaction collaborators. It also leverages Spring
Cloud Stream to integrate with the collaborating services.

## Description

A client can use the orchestrating Saga by injecting it as a bean and supply it with the many
data requests target each remote transacting service. The implementation assumes a global logical
identifier (as a job id) that in turn assumes the ownership of all individual items in the global
transaction. So, all requests are submitted with one global identifier (job id). Every submission of
a global transaction of same global identifier creates a new global transaction ID. I.e., a global
transactions - identified with one job id - can have multiple executed instances each with its own
identifying global transaction ID.

The system is design such that a global transaction will have only one global transaction instance
executing at a time. Unless a global transaction (identified with a job id) reached its final state
as completed or failed, no other invocation of the same global transaction can be executed.

This illustration assumes three individual remote services. a file storage service, a database storage
service and an immutable storage of a block chain. Only mocks of these services were implemented to mimic
a local transaction of each with some processing delays.

Once a request for each service is composed with the right data to store,
a global transaction job identifier is then supplied with these requests
to the saga to coordinate, as shown in the example below:

``` code[java]

@Autowired
private Saga saga;

JobState state = saga.addTransactionRequest(fileStorageRequest)
				.addTransactionRequest(databaseStorageRequest)
				.addTransactionRequest(blockChainStorageRequest)
				.orchestrate(jobId);
```

This invocation would then return the result of final global transaction
as a job state value. A final global transaction result could take one
of these values: JOB_COMPLETE, JOB_FAIL or JOB_TIME_OUT.

## Transaction State Machine

A global transaction would have different states throughout its lifecycle starting from
a JOB_START state and end with either JOB_FAIL or JOB_TIME_OUT. In between, a transaction
may be in a state where it tries to submit a request to store a file or cancel such request
(FILE_SUBMIT / FILE_CANCEL), and same states for the database and block chain requests
(DB_SUBMIT / DB_CANCEL, BC_SUBMIT / BC_CANCEL). Transition between these states and how
the global transaction should do when it gets to each of these states are managed with
a Spring State Machine. Using a Spring State Machine give us a luxury of:

* avoiding cluttering code with a lot of if/else statements of the orchestration cases
* defining a state machine as a well-defined configured setup in a java class
* defining what the transitions are permitted to do
* defining what action should be executed when making a transition or when a state change
* abstracting away how a transaction progresses or performs action from the orchestrator, and delegates
to the state machine to figure that out

The state machine receives events from the orchestrating Saga. Each event reflects what the Saga
has in turns receives from each individual service to indicate whether a local transaction is
successful or not.

The state machine reacts by transitioning to a proper state and as a
result fires an appropriate action of what should happen next. It does so by publishing
a request via one of the appropriate channel message. Each individual service subscribe
to its request channels, listens to coming streams of requests, performs the requested action
and publish a transaction result to the one response channel that the Saga orchestrator is listening to.


## Transaction Orchestrator

The transaction is orchestrated with a Saga which acts as a stream listener that subscribes to
a message channel. Each message is published from one of the remote services to contain the transaction
result. The Saga receives this message and reacts by firing a proper event to the state machine.
